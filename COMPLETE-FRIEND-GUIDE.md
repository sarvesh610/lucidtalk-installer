## 🔧 **Node.js Installation Options**

### **Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)**
- **Automatic**: Installs Homebrew if missing, then Node.js
- **Best for**: Most Mac users
- **Pros**: Easy, clean, updatable
- **Cons**: Larger download (installs Homebrew too)

### **Option 2: NVM (Node Version Manager)**
- **For developers**: Installs latest LTS Node.js via NVM
- **Best for**: People who might use multiple Node.js versions
- **Pros**: Professional setup, version management
- **Cons**: More complex for non-developers

### **Option 3: Direct Download**
- **Manual**: Downloads and extracts Node.js to `~/.local/nodejs`
- **Best for**: People who want minimal installation
- **Pros**: No additional tools installed
- **Cons**: Manual path management

### **Option 4: Manual**
- **External**: Directs to nodejs.org for manual installation
- **Best for**: People who prefer official installers
- **Pros**: Official, GUI installer
- **Cons**: Requires manual steps
